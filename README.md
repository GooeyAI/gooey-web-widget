# Gooey Web Widget

A clean, self-hostable web widget for Gooey.AI Copilots, with streaming support with every major LLM, speech-reco, and Text-to-Speech covering 1000+ languages, photo uploads, feedback, and analytics.

Fork for customized branding and functionality (or use our hosted version available under Copilot Integrations).

## Raw Library Usage

If you're new, you should probably head over to [gooey.ai/copilot](https://gooey.ai/copilot/integrations/), create and test your integration there. This guide is for **advanced users**.

1. Copy the following code into the `<body>` section of your target HTML file where you want the widget to appear:

```html
<div id="gooey-embed"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GooeyAI/gooey-web-widget@2/dist/lib.js"></script>
<script>
  GooeyEmbed.mount({
    target: "#gooey-embed",
    integration_id: "Kbo" # Your Integration ID,
  });
</script>
```

If you use the lib.js provided from gooey.ai, the config will be automatically provided based on your settings.

```html
<script src="https://gooey.ai/chat/<Name>-<Integration ID>/lib.js"></script>
```

2. Replace `"Kbo"` with your Integration's ID, as it appears on the Integration tab.

## Configuration Options

##### Example:

```js
const config = {
  target: "#gooey-embed",
  integration_id: "Kbo",
  mode: "popup" | "inline" | "fullscreen",
  enableAudioMessage: true,
  showSources: true,
  enablePhotoUpload: true,
  enableConversations: true,
  branding: {
    name: "Farmer.CHAT",
    byLine: "By Digital Green",
    description:
      "An AI Assistant designed to help farmer extension agents in India.",
    conversationStarters: [
      "When should I plant chili?",
      "How can I get rid of black ants on my coffee?",
      "What is the best time to grow pepper in India?",
    ],
    fabLabel: "Help",
    photoUrl:
      "https://digitalgreen.org/wp-content/themes/digital-green/images/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png",
    websiteUrl: "https://digitalgreen.org/",
    showPoweredByGooey: true,
    color: { primary: "purple", "secondary": "blue" },
  },
  payload: {
    user_id: "123",
    variables: {
      product_id: "sample_id",
      product_name: "sample_name",
    },
  },
};
GooeyEmbed.mount(config);
```

##### `target: string` **Required**

Specifies the [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp) of the div where the widget will be embedded.

##### `integration_id: string` **Required**

The unique identifier for your Gooey Bot Integration. (Note that this is snake_case, to match the Gooey API `payload`)

##### `mode: string (popup | inline)`

Determines how the Gooey widget is displayed on your site:

- `popup`: This mode renders a Floating Action Button that, when clicked, opens the widget in a pop-up overlay. Ideal for adding support chat without altering your page layout.

![popup](https://github.com/GooeyAI/gooey-web-widget/assets/10388784/f04df2d3-c811-4950-8cff-1a13c80b9def)

- `inline`: This mode embeds the widget directly within the page content at the location specified by the `target`. Suitable for integrating the widget as a part of your webpage like a contact form.

- `fullscreen`: This mode renders the widget in fullscreen mode, covering the entire page. Ideal for creating a dedicated chat page.

## **Project Setup Guide**

### Initial Setup

1. Install Node LTS version (v18) using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):
   ```bash
   nvm install 18.12.0
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GooeyAI/gooey-web-widget.git
   ```
3. Navigate into your cloned directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd gooey-web-widget
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the React server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the project.

### Building and Testing

1. Build the library:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. The output will be available in the `dist/` directory.
3. Test the widget opening `test.html` in your browser.
4. To test inside other projects, run a python web server:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 9000
   ```

   and open [localhost:9000/test.html](http://localhost:9000/test.html) in your browser.

   (For the gooey server, set `WEB_WIDGET_LIB=http://localhost:9000/dist/lib.js` )

## Publishing

1. Update the version in `package.json`, run `npm install` and commit the changes

2. Publish the library:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/publish.sh
   ```
3. Purge the [jsdelivr cache](https://www.jsdelivr.com/tools/purge)

Now "jsdeliver" will automatically catch the tagged commit by "2.x.x".
If you want to ensure your clients get the latest version of the lib (ahead of the cache), please specify the version in the URL like so: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GooeyAI/gooey-web-widget@2.x.x/dist/lib.js`

For Gooey Server, update the `WEB_WIDGET_LIB` environment variable. 11. If you make a major version change, update this README.md and `WEB_WIDGET_LIB` in the Gooey server.

## **Notes**

- `src/widgets/*`: List of embeddable React components.
- `index.html` + `src/main.js`: Entry point for the development React app.
- `src/lib.tsx`: Library entry point for the widget.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration for bundling the library.

### ðŸ’£ Secret Scanning

Gitleaks will automatically run pre-commit (see `pre-commit-config.yaml` for details) to prevent commits with secrets in the first place. To test this without committing, run `pre-commit` from the terminal. To skip this check, use `SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m "message"` to commit changes. Preferably, label false positives with the `#gitleaks:allow` comment instead of skipping the check.

Gitleaks will also run in the CI pipeline as a GitHub action on push and pull request (can also be manually triggered in the actions tab on GitHub). To update the baseline of ignored secrets, run `python ./scripts/create_gitleaks_baseline.py` from the venv and commit the changes to `.gitleaksignore`.
